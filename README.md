This notebook plots and analyzes data from a pharmaceutical trial on rats. 
Capomulin, Ceftamin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Naftisol, Propriva, Ramicane, Stelasyn, Zoniferol were administered as well as a placebo group. 
Body weight and tumor volumes were assessed at ten timepoints and recorded to determine treatment efficacy.

Observations:
1) Only Ramicane and Capomulin significantly outperformed placebo in reducing tumor volume in this study. These two drugs reduced tumor volume by almost 50%, with less variance in tumor sizes compared to the other treatment regimen.\n"

2) Ramicane and Capomulin were more predictable treatment options with lower variance and SEM values.

3) Tumor size and bodyweight have a moderate positive correlation. This is logical as tumors require large amounts of energy to support their rapid growth and heavier hosts would support larger tumors.

4) This study had a well balanced demographic although for future studies I think it could be argued that the placebo group should have the fewer number of samples, although this could skew randomization."   ]
